Custom AngularJS UI Bootstrap
------
New directive: 
####toggledDisplay - A generalized "dropdown" directive
This directive is almost identical to the "dropdown" directive of AngularJs UI Bootstrap.
There are only two differences:

1. Use customized css rules for show&hide instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap "dropdown-menu" class
2. The element which gets toggled does not close (toggle close) itself when clicked on. This element should be identified with the toggled-display-area directive
